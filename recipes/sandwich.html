            <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>
                    Grilled cheese is a classic American sandwich that has been around 
                    since 1920. It is a hot sandwich made with buttered and toasted bread 
                    and originally filled with American cheese, but is now commonly made 
                    with one or more different cheeses.

                    <li>
                        Spread 1/2 Tbsp butter on one side of each slice of bread.

                    <li>
                        Place a skillet over low to medium/low heat. 
                        A griddle should be at 275˚F. Immediately add 2 slices of 
                        bread with the butter-side-down.

                        Stack cheese on one of the pieces of bread, cover with 
                        the other piece of toast and flip the sandwich over.

                        Continue sauteeing, flipping once, until both sides 
                        are golden brown and cheese is melted.
